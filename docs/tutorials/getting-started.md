## ðŸ“‹ **Basic Workflow**

### **1. Plan Your Assets**
- Determine what type of game you're creating
- List the assets you'll need (characters, environments, items, etc.)
- Consider your art style and theme

### **2. Generate Base Assets**
- Start with core elements (player character, basic enemies)
- Generate environmental assets (trees, rocks, buildings)
- Create UI elements and effects

### **3. Customize and Refine**
- Use the parameter controls to adjust colors, sizes, and styles
- Experiment with different variations
- Save your favorite configurations as presets

### **4. Batch Processing**
- Use the batch generator for multiple similar assets
- Export entire collections at once
- Organize assets into folders and projects

### **5. Integration**
- Export assets in your preferred format
- Import into your game engine (Unity, Godot, etc.)
- Use the level generator for complete game environments

## ðŸŽ® **Game Engine Integration**

### **Unity**
```csharp
// Example: Loading TPT-generated sprites
public Sprite LoadTPTSprite(string assetPath) {
    Texture2D texture = LoadTexture(assetPath);
    return Sprite.Create(texture, new Rect(0, 0, texture.width, texture.height), Vector2.zero);
}
```

### **Godot**
```gdscript
# Example: Using TPT-generated levels
func load_tpt_level(level_path: String) -> Node2D:
    var level_data = load_json(level_path)
    return create_level_from_data(level_data)
```

### **Generic Game Engines**
- Export as PNG for sprites
- Export as JSON for level data
- Export as WAV/MP3 for audio
- Use the provided integration libraries

## ðŸ”§ **Advanced Features**

### **Preset System**
- Save your favorite configurations
- Share presets with the community
- Create project-specific presets

### **Batch Generation**
- Generate multiple assets at once
- Apply consistent styling across collections
- Automate repetitive tasks

### **Asset Library**
- Organize assets with folders and tags
- Search and filter your collection
- Preview assets before use

### **Export Options**
- Multiple image formats (PNG, JPEG, WebP)
- Audio formats (WAV, MP3, OGG)
- Level formats (JSON, TMX for Tiled)
- Batch export with custom naming

## ðŸŽ¯ **Best Practices**

### **Asset Organization**
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Group related assets in folders
- Tag assets for easy searching
- Create project-specific collections

### **Performance Optimization**
- Generate assets at appropriate resolutions
- Use batch processing for large collections
- Optimize export settings for your target platform
- Monitor memory usage during large generations

### **Quality Assurance**
- Preview assets before export
- Test assets in your game engine
- Validate file formats and compatibility
- Check for visual consistency
